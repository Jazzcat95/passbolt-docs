## Introduction

To run LDAPS your LDAP server must offer a valid SSL certificate to the client which in this case that client
is the passbolt server. It is also required that the SSL certificate is trusted by your passbolt instance.

There are two ways of obtaining your SSL certificate, listed below.

### Your LDAP server is offering a SSL certificate obtained by a public Certificate Authority

If your SSL certificate has been obtained through a public and well known SSL certificate authority such
as [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) your certificate would be automatically trusted by the passbolt
instance unless otherwise specified by your SSL provider.

Most of the time in this scenario your passbolt instance will not require any extra configuration.

### Your LDAP server is offering a SSL certificate obtained from a private Certficate Authority or a self-signed certificate

Some organizations run LDAP on a private network on-premises. In these scenarios it is very common that your
organization has a private SSL certificate authority that generates SSL certificates valid only on the private network.

If this is your scenario you probably will need a CA certificate to trust the private SSL certificate offered
by your LDAP server if the LDAP SSL certificate is not chained correctly.

If the LDAP SSL certificate is not chained correctly meaning that it is not offering both the CA certificate
and SSL certificate on connection you must obtain and upload the CA certificate to your passbolt instance.

## Configure passbolt server to trust a private LDAPS certificate

### Step 1: Ping the server

The first step is to understand what is causing the issue and be sure that it's related to a certificate issue.

We first try to ping the server and see if it goes through.

```bash
ping your_ldap_server.com
```

If it does not go through, check that there is a corresponding entry for your domain / server ip in `/etc/hosts`.
If it's not there add it.

If it goes through, we will then try to execute a similar LDAP query to what passbolt does using ldapsearch.

### Step 2: Connect with ldapsearch

:::warning
As passbolt will connect to your LDAP server as the web user, it is important to execute the ldapsearch command
as this user (**www-data** for Debian/Ubuntu, **wwwrun** for OpenSUSE, **nginx** for RHEL based Linux distributions).
:::

```bash
sudo su -s /bin/bash -c 'ldapsearch -x -D "username" -W -H ldaps://your_ldap_server.com -b "dc=domain,dc=com" -d 9' www-data
```

Do not forget to replace the 'username', 'your_ldap_server.com', 'domain' and 'com' variables with the real ones.

If after this command is executed you see your objects returned, it means that the LDAPS connection is going
through and that there must be an issue with the parameters you entered in passbolt LDAP plugin. You should
check them again and make sure that they are alright.

If this command returns something as displayed below, then you most likely have a LDAPS certificate issue.

```bash
$ sudo su -s /bin/bash -c 'ldapsearch -x -D "ada" -W -H ldaps://your_ldap_server.com -b "dc=passbolt,dc=local" -d 9' www-data

ldap_url_parse_ext(ldaps://your_ldap_server.com)
ldap_create
ldap_url_parse_ext(ldaps://your_ldap_server.com:636/??base)
Enter LDAP Password:
ldap_sasl_bind
ldap_send_initial_request
ldap_new_connection 1 1 0
ldap_int_open_connection
ldap_connect_to_host: TCP your_ldap_server.com:636
ldap_new_socket: 3
ldap_prepare_socket: 3
ldap_connect_to_host: Trying 172.16.0.50:636
ldap_pvt_connect: fd: 3 tm: -1 async: 0
attempting to connect:
connect success
ldap_err2string
ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)
```

If that's the case, the good news is that it's quite easy to fix. The issue is that the client is not trusting
the certificate provided by the server. Let's fix this by moving forward to the next step.

### Step 3: Download a correctly chained SSL certificate

OpenLDAP requires usually the entire chained certificate. We have developed a quick utility that aims to help
retrieve all the parts of a LDAPS certificate and bundle them together. You can access this tool
[here](https://github.com/passbolt/ldaps_cert_util).

Follow the README instructions, retrieve your certificate and move to step 2.

### Step 4: Tell OpenLDAP to use the right certificate

#### Using passbolt.php or environment variables (beta)

With the v4.7 release, we have introduced a configuration where you can specify your custom root CA certificate details.

```php
// config/passbolt.php

return [
    'passbolt' => [
        ...

        'plugins' => [
            ...

              'directorySync' => [
                ...
                'security' => [
                    'sslCustomOptions' => [
                        'enabled' => true,
                        'verifyPeer' => true,
                        'cadir' => '/etc/ssl/certs',
                        'cafile' => '/etc/ssl/certs/cert.crt',
                    ],
                ],
            ],

            ...

        ],

        ...
    ],
];
```

Or, you can also set the above values via environment variables as well:

```bash
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_ENABLED=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_VERIFY_PEER=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_CADIR="/etc/ssl/certs"
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_CAFILE="/etc/ssl/certs/cert.crt"
```

:::info
You should either set the root CA certificate via `ldap.conf` or via passbolt configurations(`passbolt.php` / env variables), not both.
:::

That's it. It should work now. Go back to step 1 and execute the ldapsearch command again. You should see a
successful connection to your LDAPS server happening. If that's the case, you can get back to Passbolt and try
the synchronization again.

#### Using LDAP extension configuration file (deprecated)

In Debian:

```bash
nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
```

_Note that the `ldap.conf` can also be found in `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`, depending on your distro._

The content of the file should look like:

<CodeBlock>
{`#
# LDAP Defaults
#

# See ldap.conf(5) for details
# This file should be world readable but not world writable.

#BASE   dc=example,dc=com
#URI    ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666

#SIZELIMIT      12
#TIMELIMIT      15
#DEREF          never

# TLS certificates (needed for GnuTLS)
TLS_CACERT      /etc/ssl/certs/cert.crt
`}
</CodeBlock>

Edit the line with `TLS_CACERT` to make it point to the right certificate.

### Alternatively, disable SSL certificate verification

If for some obscure reason, OpenLDAP was still refusing to cooperate, you can try telling him to ignore the certificate.

:::warning
Do this for test purposes only. This practice is insecure and could make your server prone to MITM attacks.

#### Using passbolt.php or environment variables (beta)

```php
// config/passbolt.php

return [
    'passbolt' => [
        ...

        'plugins' => [
            ...

              'directorySync' => [
                ...
                'security' => [
                    'sslCustomOptions' => [
                        'enabled' => true,
                        'verifyPeer' => false,
                    ],
                ],
            ],

            ...

        ],

        ...
    ],
];
```

Or, you can also set the above values via environment variables as well:

```bash
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_ENABLED=true
export PASSBOLT_PLUGINS_DIRECTORY_SYNC_SECURITY_SSL_CUSTOM_OPTIONS_VERIFY_PEER=false
```

Now after ignoring the certificate if the connection is going through, it means that there might be some issues with your certificate.

#### Using LDAP extension configuration file (deprecated)

```bash
nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
```

Then add the below line:
```bash
TLS_REQCERT never
```
