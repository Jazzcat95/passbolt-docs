## Certificates
:::info[IMPORTANT]
The windows application requires HTTPS to work.
:::

### Which certificate are you using?

#### Let's Encrypt
There is usually no server issues with a certificate issued by rootCA (here, Let's Encrypt), you should be able to upload the account kit and proceed further without any issues.

#### Self-signed certificate
If you've chose to use a self-signed certificate, you need to trust it on your OS, but before proceeding, you have to download the certificate.


- Navigate to the instance URL and click on "Unsecure connexion"

- Click on the "Show certificate" Icon, usually where it is written "Certificate is not valid"

- Make sure that you are setting the extension file to ".cer"

Now that the file has been downloaded:
- Double-click on the file
- Install Certificate
- Choose Local Machine (otherwise it will ask to do it every two weeks)
  - Click "Yes"
- Place all certificate in the following store
- Browse the folder path
  - Trusted Root Certification Authorities
- Click on "Finish"

That's it! You should not face any errors while configuring the windows application and importing your account kit.

## Server error
If after following the steps above, it is not working, you might be encountering a server internal error.

You may have to manually clear the windows credentials manager.

- Search for "Credentials Manager"
- Go to "Web Credentials"
  - It should have only three web credentials object
    - Delete them
- Proceed again to the installation of the certificate

### Still not working?

If you run into any issues, this is usually related to one of these three behaviour.

- There is still cache data in *Credentials Manager > Web Credentials* on Windows
  - Delete the three objects inside
- The folder path is wrong when installing the certificate
  - The certificate should be imported in **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
- The certificate hasn't been properly imported
  - You have to re-download the certificate and trust the certificate again.
