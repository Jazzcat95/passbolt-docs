## How to preview a TOTP on Desktop
Since version 4.3.0, Passbolt supports creation of TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) via
    [Mobile](/user/basic-features/mobile/totp-mobile/). However, it is still possible to preview those TOTP from the Web UI

<Figure
  src={
    '/img/help/2023/10/totp_web_preview.png'
  }
  caption="fig. Web UI - Preview TOTP"
  alt="Web UI - Preview TOTP"
/>

There are two types of TOTP:

- Standalone
  - That is the **Passbolt Community TOTP** resource, this is not linked to any passwords.
- Linked to an existing password
  - The resource **Passbolt** was existing before the creation of the TOTP and has been linked to it.

From the Web UI, you are able to preview any TOTP shown in the column “TOTP”
